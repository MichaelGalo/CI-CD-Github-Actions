This repo is a CI-CD template for Python projects and Github Actions.

## Development Tools (requirements-dev.txt)

**iSort** is a Python package that sorts imports in Python files. It is used to ensure that imports are organized and follow the PEP 8 style guide.

**flake8** is a Python package that checks the style of Python code against the PEP 8 style guide. It is used to ensure that code is written in a consistent and readable manner.

**pytest** is a testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases. It supports fixtures, parameterized testing, and has excellent plugin ecosystem for extending functionality.

**mypy** is a static type checker for Python that helps catch type-related errors before runtime. It analyzes your code based on type hints and ensures type safety across your codebase.

**black** is an opinionated code formatter for Python that automatically formats your code to follow a consistent style. It eliminates debates about code formatting by enforcing a single, deterministic style.

**pandas** is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python, providing data structures like DataFrames and Series for handling structured data efficiently.

**pandas-stubs** provides type stubs for pandas, enabling better type checking and IDE support when using pandas with mypy and other type checkers.
